# Precompile Hardhat Tasks

Node.js v20 or greater is recommended

Before getting started make sure you have changed to the hardhat directory and have installed the required
dependencies:

```bash
cd tools/hardhat
npm install
```

## Networks

Hardhat is configured with the following supported networks:

* `testnet` for connecting to the public testnet.
* `mainnet` soon..

All tasks and scripts support hardhat's global options which includes the `--network` flag. `testnet` is
used by default if no network is set. If running a task or script against `mainnet` ensure you include
`--network mainnet` as a hardhat argument.

## Accounts

Hardhat [vars](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/configuration-variables) are used for configuring
accounts/keys.

```text
WARNING

Configuration variables are stored in plain text on your disk. Avoid using this feature for data you wouldnâ€™t
normally save in an unencrypted file. Run npx hardhat vars path to find the storage's file location.
```

You can determine what `vars` are available by running:

```bash
npx hardhat vars setup
```

The vars can be set to either a) a single private key, or b) a comma separated list (no whitespace) of private keys.

```bash
npx hardhat vars set MEZO_ACCOUNTS
```

List availables accounts:

```bash
npx hardhat vars get MEZO_ACCOUNTS
```

And can be removed with:

```bash
npx hardhat vars delete MEZO_ACCOUNTS
```

## Tasks

We name Hardhat [Tasks](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/create-task) with a precompile prefix. This
provides clarity on which precompile the task runs against, and keeps the output of `npx hardhat help` clean as
precompile tasks get grouped together. You can view the available tasks with:

```bash
npx hardhat help
```

*Note: The default Hardhat tasks are still visible (e.g `compile`), many of these will do nothing as we are only using
Hardhat for tasks/testing.*

Help information for a specific task can be obtained using

```bash
npx hardhat help <TASK>
```

e.g:

```bash
npx hardhat help validatorPool:validator
```

```bash
Usage: hardhat [GLOBAL OPTIONS] validatorPool:validator --operator <STRING>

OPTIONS:

  --operator The validator's operator address

validatorPool:validator: Returns a validator's consensus public key & description
```

Here we can see the validatorPool:validator task has an operator argument - correct usage would be:

```bash
npx hardhat --network testnet validatorPool:validator --operator 0xc2f7Ae302a68CF215bb3dA243dadAB3290308015
```

### Running Tasks

Tasks get run as if they are built in hardhat commands. Read tasks are executed using a basic ethers provider
(no account), e.g:

```bash
npx hardhat --network testnet validatorPool:submitApplication --operator <validator address> --conspubkey <validator consensus address> --moniker <mezod moniker>
```

### How to Submit an application to Validator Pool

Here is a step by step guide on how to submit an application to the PoA validator pool.

```bash
# step 1
# fund your account

# step 2
# submit your application to the validator pool. Available flags:
# --flow (docker|native) This is mandatory
# --network (testnet) Thi is optional, it defaults to testnet
./submit-application.sh --flow docker

# you can check your application
npx hardhat --network testnet validatorPool:application --operator <your validator address>
```
